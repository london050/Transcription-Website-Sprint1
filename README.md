# Transcription-Website-Sprint1

The Auto Transcriber & Translator is a Python-based application that automatically converts audio or video files into timestamped transcripts and captions, with optional translation into other languages. Built with Whisper for speech recognition and MarianMT for translation, it uses FFmpeg to preprocess input media into standardized 16 kHz mono .wav files. The system outputs synchronized .txt, .srt, .vtt, and .json files—each containing the transcribed or translated text with precise timing data. Users can run it via a simple CLI or interact through a lightweight FastAPI web server. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline integrating audio processing, deep learning, and practical deployment, designed for accessibility and reproducibility across platforms.
