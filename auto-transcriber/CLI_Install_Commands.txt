CLI installation commands:

1. First Upgrade pip to latest version:

  pip install --upgrade pip

2. Install dependencies.

  pip install torch

  pip install openai-whisper

  pip install transformers

  pip install fastapi

  pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

  pip install python-multipart

  (You can do these all in one line of "pip install x, y, z" if you really want,
  but I recommend one at a time to ensure you know exactly where the problem lies
  if there happens to be one.)

3. Verify FFmpeg (macOS / Windows)

  (Note: you need to have the "homebrew" package manager on mac and the
  "Chocolatey" package manaer on Windows to install the following.)

  macOS:
    brew install ffmpeg

  Windows:
    choco install ffmpeg

  Check version (Both windows and Mac)
    ffpmeg -version


4. Run "check_dependencies.py" script to ensure everything is downloaded correctly.
